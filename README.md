- 👋 Hi, I’m @KungFuChihuahua  
- 👀 **Interests:** Anything with a V8 engine and corners like it’s on rails (cars or code, take your pick).  
- 🌱 **Currently learning:** How to automate the world one application at a time.  
- 💞️ **Looking to collaborate on:** Automating the impossible and scaling the unscalable.  
- 📫 **How to reach me:** I'm as elusive as the A-Team, but if you crack the code, we might just fix the unfixable together.  
- 😄 **Pronouns:** Code/Compile  
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** My Chihuahua thinks she’s the boss—and honestly, she’s probably right. When she’s not supervising, I’m fixing anything that’s broken, not just code.  
- 🤖 **Bonus automation:** My robot mower handles the lawn so I can focus on fixing everything else that’s broken.  
- 🧐 **Wise saying:** Confucius says, “He who writes no unit tests will debug thrice as long.”  
- 🎩 **Hidden talent:** Debugging code, appliances, and bad life decisions—all before finishing my first soda of the day.  
- 🚀 **Motto:** Move fast and fix things—because breaking them is too mainstream.  
- 🛠️ **Tools of the trade:** C#, .NET, and an endless supply of duct tape for life’s unexpected bugs.  
- 🎮 **When not coding:** I’m probably 3D printing, tinkering with DIY gadgets, or convincing my Chihuahua that I’m in charge.
